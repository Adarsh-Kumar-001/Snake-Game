# # Snake Game (College Project)

## Introduction
Welcome to the Snake Game! This is a console-based game written in C, featuring a classic arcade-style experience where players control a snake to navigate the screen, eat food, and grow in length while avoiding collisions. The game includes a leaderboard system to track player scores efficiently.

## Background
This game is implemented in C, making use of efficient data types and optimized code while avoiding predefined data structures. It is structured across multiple files for better organization and maintainability. The project is open-sourced on GitHub for further development and contributions.

### Features:
- Console-based gameplay with smooth controls
- Efficient implementation using fundamental data structures
- No use of predefined data structures for better learning and optimization
- CSV file support for storing player scores
- Leaderboard system to track high scores
- Multiple file distribution for code organization
- Open-sourced on GitHub for community collaboration

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Run the program in the console.
2. **Control the Snake**: Use `W` (up), `A` (left), `S` (down), and `D` (right) keys to move the snake.
3. **Eat Food**: Guide the snake to the food items on the screen to increase your score.
4. **Avoid Collisions**: Do not let the snake collide with the walls or itself, or the game will end.
5. **Leaderboard**: Scores are saved in a CSV file, allowing players to compete for the highest score.
